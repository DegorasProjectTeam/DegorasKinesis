/**
 * @brief Generic background status-polling worker, device- and SDK-agnostic.
 * @tparam StatusT Plain status payload produced each poll and delivered to the sink.
 *
 * @details Each poll interval the worker calls a @ref Producer to fill a @p StatusT and then hands the
 *          (result, status) pair to a @ref Sink. Both callables are supplied at start() and copied into the
 *          worker, so the poller stores no pointer to the owning device.
 *
 * Lifetime & threading contract:
 *  - The sink is always invoked on the worker thread, never while holding any poller lock. Non-OK results are
 *    delivered to the sink (not silently dropped) so the owner can surface a lost connection.
 *  - Cancellation is prompt: stop() signals a condition variable, so the worker wakes immediately instead of
 *    sleeping out the remaining interval.
 *  - stop() performs a BOUNDED join: if the worker does not finish within @p join_timeout (e.g. it is wedged in a
 *    blocking SDK call on unplugged hardware) it is DETACHED rather than joined, so a destructor can never hang.
 *  - Self-destruct safe: if the owner is destroyed from inside the sink callback, stop() runs on the worker thread;
 *    it detaches instead of self-joining (which would deadlock). The worker holds its own shared_ptr to the internal
 *    State, so its post-callback stop-check and notification remain valid even after the poller is destroyed.
 *
 * @warning A detached, wedged worker leaks for the remainder of the process. This is bounded to genuinely stuck
 *          hardware and is deliberately preferred over a hanging shutdown.
 *
 * @note Generic, project-agnostic infrastructure: candidate to migrate into LibDegorasBase if shared across the
 *       Degoras libraries, rather than reimplemented per project.
